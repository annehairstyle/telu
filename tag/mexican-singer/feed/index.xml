<h3>Earnings Across Different Periods</h3>
<p>Gloria Trevi&#8217;s earnings have fluctuated over the years, influenced by the popularity of her music, the success of her tours, and the popularity of her other ventures. </p>
<ul>

<li>The legal controversies Trevi faced in the late 1990s resulted in a significant drop in her earnings, as she faced legal battles and a hiatus from her career. This period likely led to substantial legal fees and a decrease in income from music sales, tours, and endorsements.</p>
</li>
